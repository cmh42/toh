Moreover, in general, when $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ does diverge, we are able to find some small $n$ such  that $|z_n| > 2$.

    "It turns out that, given any complex number $c$, inspection of the initial segment $(z_0,z_1,\\dots, z_{99})$ comprising the first $100$ terms of the Mandelbrot sequence induced by $c$ gives us a  good guess as to whether or not $c$ does lie in the Mandelbrot set or not. Here we mean of course that we guess that $c$ is **not** in the Mandelbrot set  if and only if  for some $n < 100$, $|z_n| > 2$. Moreover when we implement the functions and code that we define below to draw the Mandelbrot set we need to assume a fixed number of iterations throughout our code. Accordingly here we  choose to use $100$ for this value. However of course we might in future want to refine our work by increasing the number of iterations.   Thus it makes sense  to define a global variable assigned to the maximum number of iterations (instead of, for example, passing this in to each function as a parameter). This we now do using the value $100$, in the cell below which you should run (otherwise the rest of your code will not execute.)  "

    "### Part 5: plot the Mandelbrot set\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have noticed that our function `make_mandelbrot_data` returns three numpy arrays of the type that the pyplot pixellated plotting function `pcolor` takes as its first three input arguments. The matrices/arrays returned correspond respectively to the $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates in 3 dimensions with the $z$ coordinate corresponding to the output $n$ of the function `mantel` on complex number $c = x + yi$. Remember that $c$ is (or, more precisely, we guess that it is)  in the Mandelbrot set if this  output $n$ is  $=$ `MAXITER` and $c$ is not in the set otherwise (i.e. if $n <$ `MAXITER`). The function `pcolor` calibrates the colours of each point $c$ in the complex plane (or at least in our grid) according to the size of $n$ and hence we can see for each point if it is either  in the Mandelbrot set  or otherwise \"how far out\" of, the Mandelbrot set it is according to the colour attributed to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should now proceed by retrieving (via the function `make_mandelbrot_data` the mandelbrot data on the region $[-2,1] \\times [-1.5,1,5]$ of the complex plane with, for example `NUM_POINTS = 401` many coordinates for both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should then plot your result in a similar manner to that used in the example of Part 3, or in subsection \"Pixellated plot using `pcolor`\" of Lecture 4.2. We suggest that you use the colour map 'gist_ncar' (instead of the colour map 'PuOr' above or 'PiYG'  used in Lecture 4.2) as this allows you to see clearly how the $n$ values output by the  `mandel` function vary. There are however lots of colour maps that you can choose from: you can copy and paste the names from the page <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html\">https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html</a> . To define the colour limits you should set  `vmin = 1` and `vmax = MAXITER`. (We know that these are the minimum and maximum values returned by the function `mandel` on the region $[-2,1] \\times [-1.5,1,5]$ so there is no need to compute these values as we have done in other examples.) \n",
