    "Suppose  that $j_p$ is some (fixed) complex number. We define  the **Julia set with parameter $j_p$** to be  the set of values $c$ in the complex plane such that the sequence $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ defined by the recurrence relation \n",

    "is bounded. We say that $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ is the  *Julia sequence with parameter $j_p$ induced by* $c$. (It would be more correct to write it as, for example $\\big(z^{j_p,c}_n\\big)_{n \\ge 0}$ to explicitly show the dependence on the paramater $j_p$ and the number  $c$. However this would clutter our notation.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder 1.** $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ being bounded means that, for some natural number (or positive real number) $N$, $|z_n| \\le N$ for all $n \\ge 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above definition means that, given complex number $c$ the Julia sequence $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ with parameter $j_p$ induced by $c$  starts as: $z_0 = c$, $z_1 = c^2 + j_p$, $z_2 = (c^2 + j_p)^2 + j_p$, $z_3 = ((c^2 + j_p)^2 + j_p)^2 + j_p$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1.** We know that, for given parameter $j_p$ and complex number $c$ the Julia sequence $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ with parameter $j_p$ induced by $c$  diverges to infinity - i.e. is NOT bounded - precisely in the case when $|z_n| > R$ for some $n$, where $R$ is the positive root of the quadratic equation \n",

    "\n",
    "(Since this is equivalent to saying that $(|z_n|)_{n \\ge 0}$ is bounded below by a geometric series with common ratio greater than $1$.)\n",
    "Moreover, in general, when $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ does diverge, we are able to find some small $n$ such  that $|z_n| > R$.  Thus we can compute a good guess as to whether $c$ is in the Julia set with parameter $j_p$ or not by inspecting some fixed number of initial terms of the Julia sequence $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ with parametr $j_p$ induced by $c$, whatever the value of $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2.** If $|c| > R$ (with $j_p$ and $R$ defined as in Note 1) then $|z_0| > R$ and so the sequence $(z_n)_{n \\ge 0}$ with parameter $j_p$ induced by $c$ diverges (whatever the value of the fixed parameter $j_p$). Thus the only region of the plane of interest to us lies within the  $2R \\times 2R$ square of the Complex Plane centred at 0 (with $R + Ri$ as top right corner etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder 2.** The complex number number $z = a + bi$ is represented as `a` $+$ `b*1j` in python. I.e. in python the $\\sqrt{-1}$ is represented by `1j`. Remember also that $|z| := \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and can be computed in python using `abs(z)`.\n",

    "Similarly to the function `make_mandelbrot_data` of the Tutorial of Week 4 `make_julia_data`  returns three numpy arrays of the type that the pyplot pixellated plotting function `pcolor` takes as its first three input arguments. The matrices/arrays returned correspond respectively to the $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates in 3 dimensions where, for each point $(x,y,z)$,  the coordinate $z$ is the  integer returned by the function `julia` with inputs $j_p$ and $c := x +iy$ where $j_p$ is the Julia set parameter passed as an argument to `make_julia_data`. Remember that $c$ is (or, more precisely, we guess that it is)  in the Julia set with paramater $j_p$ if $z =$ `MAXITER` and $c$ is not in the set otherwise (i.e. if $z <$ `MAXITER`). The function `pcolor` calibrates the colours of each point $c$ in the complex plane (or at least in our grid) according to the size of $z$  and hence we can see for each point if it is either  in the Julia set  or otherwise \"how far out\" of, the Julia set it is according to the colour attributed to it. \n",

The details for this are as follows. \n",

    "- To define the colour limits (for every subplot)  you should set `vmin = 0` and `vmax = MAXITER`\n",

However in the final version that you submit for grading make sure that the number of coordinates is set to 200 and NOT more.
